1. Project Title
InfraVision: AI-Powered Complaint Management System

2. Summary of Work Done

Proposal and Idea Submission:
In the initial phase, we identified the need for an intelligent complaint management system that leverages Generative AI and image recognition to streamline the process of submitting, categorizing, and resolving complaints in an organization or campus setting. The objectives were:
- Automate complaint categorization using AI.
- Enable users to submit complaints with images and text.
- Provide an intuitive web interface for users and administrators.
- Integrate a custom-trained image classification model for enhanced accuracy.

A detailed proposal was submitted, outlining the problem, objectives, required tools, and expected outcomes.

Execution and Demonstration:
The project was implemented using a modern web stack:
- Frontend: React.js (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- AI Integration: Local TensorFlow.js image model for classification, Gemini (Google's generative AI) for complaint text generation
- Deployment: Vite for frontend, Node.js server for backend

Key accomplishments include:
- Developed a user-friendly interface for complaint submission, including image upload and text input.
- Integrated a local TensorFlow.js model for real-time, client-side image classification.
- Implemented backend APIs for complaint management and Gemini-powered text generation.
- Enabled real-time feedback to users on complaint status and category.
- Documented the codebase and provided setup instructions.

4. Testing Phase

4.1 Testing Strategy
The system was tested across multiple scenarios to ensure reliability and accuracy:
- Input Handling: Verified the system's ability to process various complaint types, image formats, and text lengths.
- AI Model Accuracy: Tested the local image classification model with diverse complaint images to ensure correct categorization.
- API Robustness: Ensured backend APIs (including Gemini integration) handle valid and invalid requests gracefully.
- User Experience: Assessed the frontend for usability and responsiveness.

4.2 Types of Testing Conducted
1. Unit Testing
   - Tested individual backend functions (e.g., image processing, complaint storage).
   - Verified frontend components (e.g., form validation, image preview).
2. Integration Testing
   - Ensured seamless interaction between frontend, backend, and AI model.
   - Tested end-to-end complaint submission and Gemini-powered complaint generation.
3. User Testing
   - Gathered feedback from test users on the ease of submitting complaints and understanding AI-generated categories.
   - Collected suggestions for UI/UX improvements.
4. Performance Testing
   - Measured response times for image uploads, AI inference, and complaint retrieval.
   - Tested with multiple concurrent users to assess scalability.

4.3 Results
- Accuracy: The local AI model accurately categorized over 90% of test complaint images.
- Gemini Output: Gemini generated clear, professional complaint messages based on model predictions.
- Response Time: Average end-to-end complaint submission and categorization took less than 2 seconds.
- Edge Cases: The system handled unsupported file types and incomplete submissions with appropriate error messages.
- User Feedback: Test users found the interface intuitive and the AI categorization helpful for faster complaint resolution.

5. Future Work
1. Model Fine-tuning
   - Further train the image model with a larger, more diverse dataset for improved accuracy.
2. Text Analysis Enhancement
   - Enhance Gemini prompt engineering for even better complaint text.
3. Admin Dashboard
   - Develop a comprehensive dashboard for administrators to track, filter, and resolve complaints efficiently.
4. Notification System
   - Implement email/SMS notifications to keep users updated on complaint status.
5. Multi-language Support
   - Add support for multiple languages in both the UI and AI models to cater to a broader user base.
6. Mobile App
   - Extend the system with a mobile application for on-the-go complaint submission and tracking.

6. Conclusion
InfraVision demonstrates the practical application of a local AI model and generative AI (Gemini) in automating and enhancing complaint management. The project showcases the integration of modern web technologies with AI models to deliver a robust, user-friendly solution for real-world organizational needs.
